first create two folders, 
src and dist or build

in src folder create index.js
in dist folder create index.html (later on it will be created by webpack)

run npm init -y
run npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

change script in package.json
    "build": "webpack --mode production"


create webpack.config.js next to package.json file
    remove --mode from script and add mode in webpack config file

loaders to manage sass images and so on

install loaders such as sass css-loader style-loader

create style related folder in src folder


npm i -d html-webpack-plugin to automatically build build folder and files inside such as html

add "dev": "webpack serve" in json and npm install -D webpack-dev-server


for backward compatibility of code
npm i -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env


npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
